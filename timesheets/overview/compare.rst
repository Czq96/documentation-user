as it is among one of their greatest investments. Having an automated time-track solution can
provide powerful insights to set and compare planned versus effective hours increasing productivity.

=====================================================
Go to the *Project* application, under :menuselection:`Reporting --> Tasks Analysis`, select the
*Pivot* view, and refine your *Measures* to *Effective Hours* and *Planned Hours*.
